## The Game
Fire Ghosts’ Cave is a game where you need to help Lucas Darkwood find the chest of gold at the end of the cave. Dodge the fire ghosts, or it's Game Over. Following the same logic as Super Mario's ghosts, to make them stop, just look at them.
Use the 'a' and 'd' keys on your keyboard to move the character, and the 'space' key to jump. When there is a Game Over, just wait 1 second for the game to restart.


## Details
- Character Animation: Fluid and realistic animations to bring your character to life, making the gaming experience more immersive.
- Platoform Movement: Intuitive movements, allowing the player to move forward, backward and jump.
- Creating Maps with Tilesets and Palettes: Using tilesets and palettes to create detailed and visually attractive maps, providing a rich and varied environment.
-  Lighting with Unity Render Pipeline: Lighting with Unity Render Pipeline in order to make the entire environment dark, highlighting only the light emitted by the protagonist's fire torch and the light emitted by the fire ghosts.

## Game Writing
Lucas Darkwood is known as one of the region's most courageous explorers. His name is synonymous with adventure and audacity. For years, he had heard stories about an underground cave filled with mysteries and hidden treasures, known as the Fire Ghosts’ Cave.

Determined to prove his courage and find the legendary chest of gold in the heart of the cave, Lucas set out on his journey. Equipped only with a torch to light his way, he entered the darkness of the cave, unaware of the dangers that awaited him.

Little did Lucas know that the Fire Ghost Cave was inhabited by several sinister creatures called, Pyra, the Fire Ghosts. These fiery beings fiercely guarded the treasure he so desired.

As Lucas advanced deeper into the cave, he could feel the presence of the flaming ghosts. Every time he turned his back, Fire Ghosts would emerge from the shadows, ready to attack. His only defense was his fiery torch, which kept the burning spirits at bay.

Luke's journey was not just a quest for riches, but also a battle for survival. He needed to be quick and cunning to avoid the Fire Ghosts as he explored the cave's intricate corridors and rooms.

At the climax of his adventure, Lucas finally reached the treasure chamber, where the golden chest gleamed in the flickering light of his torch.

With bravery and determination, Lucas uses his fiery torch to repel the burning ghosts while reaching the treasure he longs for. And so, the legend of Lucas Darkwood, the fearless explorer who defied the dangers of Fire Ghost Cave, has been told for generations, inspiring others to follow in his footsteps in search of adventure and lost treasure.
